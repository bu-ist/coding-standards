# Accessibility

Under the University’s Website Policy (the “Policy”), all new and redesigned University Websites and Web-enabled content published after the Policy’s Effective Date must comply with these [Minimum Web Accessibility Standards (MWAS)](https://www.bu.edu/mwas/). The MWAS articulate the minimum technical and visual requirements needed to comply with the Policy’s accessibility requirements for University Websites and Web-enabled content.

## WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards

The [WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/accessibility/) states that code is expected to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), version 2.2, at level AA. This is currently (2025) a stricter standard than BU's MWAS.
