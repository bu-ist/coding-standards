# IMPORTANT

This is a working draft of the coding standards updates. **DO NOT USE IT YET.**

# Coding in the spirit of our standards

We believe that code should be predictable, easy to maintain, and easy to understand. While our standards are intended to help support these ideas, we recognize that no two designers or developers will come up with the exact same solution to the same problem. We want you to code in the spirit of the law as much as follow letter of the law. And if you find any rules that go against what we're trying to accomplish, don't be afraid to challenge them [here](https://github.com/bu-ist/coding-standards/issues) and start a discussion so we can improve them.

### Code should be predictable.

Your project works alongside a complex ecosystem of plugins, frameworks, and content. In order to be able to update these things in a timely manner, everyone's code has to behave predictably and reliably. We do this by:

* [Naming everything consistently](#semantics) (Needs review)
* [Prohibiting overly specific rules](#specificity) (SASS nesting rules should reference this)
* Prohibiting overrides on certain classes (NEW ADDITION - restrict grid and utility classes)

### Code should be easy to maintain.

Themes, frameworks, and plugins are often used years into the future and pass through many hands. These items - nitpicky as they seem - help make it easy for us to share and transition projects from person to person. We accomplish this by:

* [Formatting our code consistently](#formatting) (SASS linter should be able to take care of this)
* Using the mixins and placeholder classes provided by the framework before you write custom code (NEW ADDITION FOR SASS - do not rewrite things that are already built into the framework)
* Structuring our SASS files consistently (NEW ADDITION FOR SASS - explains how to override, include/exclude, organize, and name partials, and how to deal with overriding or excluding Responsive Framework partials - we should also add this to the child starter)

### Code should be easy to understand.

When someone else looks at your code, it should be easy to understand how an element will behave and why. We also know that we can't predict every situation, and there is going to be a time where you need to break the rules. We deal with this by:

* Using `@extend` when an element needs to use grid classes or icons (NEW ADDITION FOR SASS)
* Nesting pseudo-elements and states (NEW ADDITION FOR SASS)
* Nesting media queries, feature detection, and browser-specific styles under the class they affect (NEW ADDITION FOR SASS)
* Explaining any rules we break and why with a single line comment `//` (NEW ADDITION FOR SASS - consider using a keyword)
* Using multi-line (`/* */`) comments for information that helps debug the compiled CSS, such as noting the location of a SASS placeholder class

With that said, use the rules below to guide your code towards those principles.

## Principles

These guidelines encourage the use of sensible patterns that model the best of what's out there. The goal is to write clean, performant, reusable styles that all our designers and developers can read and understand. We leverage Sass to help us accomplish this.

We feel strongly that information should be accessible to all, and as such, our standards encourage practices that keep accessibility and user choice in mind. For example, if a user turns JavaScript off, or the scripts fail, it's important to us that the meaning is still conveyed.

In the spirit of keeping information accessible to all, we also recognize that not everyone has access to the same level of technology and hardware. We strive to write performant HTML and CSS so information isn't gated to those who have fast internet connections. We write modern code where possible, but if a modern approach prevents access to critical information or presents a significant usability concern, it's not ready for us to adopt that approach without appropriate fallbacks in place.

These rules are in place because we believe in these things, as well as creating an environment where everyone can contribute to and understand our codebase.

<a name="formatting"></a>
## General Formatting

* Use new lines for each selector, declaration, and closing `}` <br>*(ProTip: configure your editor to "show invisibles" or to automatically remove end-of-line whitespace.)*
* Set indentation to **tabs**, not spaces. <br>*(ProTip: some editors like Sublime will let you set your preferred tab width for code viewing.)*
* Selectors are **flush left** except those nested within media queries or pseudo-elements
* Use one level of indentation for each declaration
* Include a single space before a `{`, after a `:`, and after each `,` in comma-separated properties and values
* Use double quotes consistently: `content: " "`
* Quote attribute values in selectors: `input[type="checkbox"]`
* URLs must be in double quotes: `background-image: url("images/bun.jpg");`
* Avoid specifying units for zero-values: `margin: 0;`
* Where possible, use descriptive values over numeric: `border: none;`
* Place the closing `}` of a ruleset in the same column as the first character of the ruleset
* Include a blank line before and after sections but not between rulesets

##### Example:

```css
.selector-one,
.selector-two {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
}
.selector-three {
	color: #ccc;
	margin: 0;
}
```

<a name="declaration-order"></a>
## Declaration Order

Declarations go in alphabetical order.

##### Example:

```css
.selector {
	bottom: 0;
	left: 0;
	position: absolute;
	right: 0;
	top: 0;
	z-index: 10;
}
```

<a name="comments"></a>
## Comments

Well commented code is extremely important. Take time to describe components, how they work, their limitations, and the way they are constructed.

* Place comments on a new line above subject.
* Make liberal use of comments to break CSS code into discrete sections.
* Use `/* */` CSS comments when you are documenting CSS, such as section labels. <br>*(ProTip: Grunt should be configured to remove all comments from its compressed output, which is best for performance, but retaining CSS comments in a secondary, uncompressed  file can be a helpful way to view and refine your Sass-ing.)*
* Use `//` Sass comments when you are documenting Sass, such as mixins.
* Add `TODO` comments detailing unfinished tasks.

##### Example:

```css
/* This is a section of related styles
----------------------------------------------------------------- */

/* This is a sub-section or basic comment */

/*
The long description is ideal for more detailed explanations and
documentation. It can include example HTML, URLs, or any other
information that is deemed necessary or useful.

TODO: This is a todo statement that describes an atomic task to be
completed at a later date. It wraps after 80 characters and following
lines are indented by 2 spaces.
*/
```

[ASCII text](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Big&t=Code%20Standards) is OK for section level comments. It's fun and useful in some editors.

<a name="sass"></a>
## Sass

* Do not include underscores or file extensions when importing SASS partials `@import "burf-theme";`
* Always place `@extend` statements before anything else in a declaration block.
* Group `@include` statements at the top of a declaration block after any `@extend` statements except for `@include breakpoint`, which you should put after your base (mobile) styles.
* Don't nest declaration blocks. It makes code hard to read on complex projects and often results unnecessarily specific selectors.
* Nesting [psuedo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) and media queries is OK. They should be last in the declaration block, separated from other properties with an empty new line.
* Braces should follow the [1TBS style variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS). Braces on a single line are not allowed.
* Always use an empty line between blocks of code.
* Child and element classes in selectors must be nested
* Nesting may not go more than three levels deep.

##### Example:

```css
.selector {
		@extend %someRule;
		@include cleafix();
		@include boxSizing(border-box);
		width: gridUnit(1);

		&:last-child {
			...
		}

		@media only screen and (min-width : 320px) {
			...
		}

		// Same as .selector .child when compiled
		.child {

			&:before {
				// This is the absolute maximum amount of nesting that is allowed
			}
		}
}
```

### Mixins

* If a mixin does not accept any arguments, do not use parentheses in the mixin declaration, and do not call the mixin with parentheses. Example: `@include vertical-center-child`

<a name="vendor-prefixes"></a>
## Vendor Prefixes

Use Sass mixins whenever possible. When writing CSS, use indentation to align values.

##### Example:

```css
.selector {
		-webkit-transition: background-color 500ms ease-out 1s;
			 -moz-transition: background-color 500ms ease-out 1s;
				 -o-transition: background-color 500ms ease-out 1s;
						transition: background-color 500ms ease-out 1s;
}
```

<a name="naming-conventions"></a>
## Naming Conventions

<a name="semantics">
### Summary of Semantics

* **Javascript:*** `.js-` prefixed class names for elements being relied upon for JavaScript selectors
* **Utilities** are prefixed with `.u-` for single purpose utility classes like `.u-underline` and `.u-capitalize`
* **Meaningful hyphens and camelCase** clarify the separation between component, descendant components, and modifiers: `componentName-subComponent-modifier`
* **Stateful classes** use `.is-` to prefix classes often toggled by JavaScript, like `.is-disabled`

<a name="ids-and-classes">
### IDs & Classes

Only use IDs for top level layout elements such as `sidebar` or `masthead`. Use classes for everything else unless an ID is needed for JavaScript. IDs and classes are camelCase with hyphens separating elements that demonstrate hierarchal relationships (see [Component Naming](#components))*.

##### Example:

```css
.btn-primary {}
.post-postHeader {}
```

<a name="specificity"></a>
### Specificity

Too much *cascading* of stylesheets can introduce [unnecessary performance](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/PrioritizeVisibleContent#UseEfficientCSSSelectors) overhead. In general, only be as specific as you need to be.

##### Example:

```css
/* Good: */
.userList a:hover { color: red; }

/* Too specific: */
ul.userList li span a:hover { color: red; }
```

<a name="javascript">
### JavaScript Selectors

syntax: `js-targetName`

JavaScript-specific classes reduce the risk that changing the structure or theme of components will inadvertently affect any required JavaScript behaviour and complex functionality. It is not necessary to use them in every case, just think of them as a tool in your utility belt. If you are creating a class, which you don't intend to use for styling, but instead only as a selector in JavaScript, you should probably be adding the `js-` prefix, but **JavaScript-specific classes should not, under any circumstances, be styled.** In practice this looks like this:

```css
<a href="/login" class="btn btn-primary js-login"></a>
```

<a name="utilities">
### Utilities

Utility classes are simple structural and positional traits abstracted for use on any element. Multiple utilities can be used together, and utilities can be used alongside components. Utilities exist because certain CSS properties and patterns are used frequently. For example: clearing floats, vertical alignment, text truncation. Relying on utilities can help to reduce repetition and provide consistent implementations.

##### Naming:

syntax: `u-utilityName`

Utilities must use a camelCase name, prefixed with a `u-` namespace. What follows is an example of how various utilities can be used to create a simple structure within a component.

##### Example:

```css
<div class="u-clearFix">
	<p class="u-textTruncate">...</p>
	<img class="u-pullLeft" src="..." alt="...">
</div>
```

<a name="components">
### Components

Components are custom elements that enclose specific semantics, styling, and behaviour. Always look to abstract components. The reuse of components across designs helps to improve consistency and reduces code overhead. A name like `.homepageNews` limits its use. Instead think about writing styles in such a way that they can be reused in other parts of the app. Try instead `.newsList`, which could be reused in another context.

A subcomponent is a descendant of a component. It's main purpose is to describe and style a permanent part of a component, like `.newsPost-metaData`.

##### Naming:

Component and subcompontent names must be written in camelCase. Modifiers are lowercase with hyphens.

syntax: `componentName-subComponent-modifier`

##### Example:

```css
.navBar {
	(...)
}

.navBar-contentNav {
	(...)
}

.navBar-contentNav-collabsible {
	(...)
}

/* Modifiers can also be appended to components without subcomponents */

.btn {
	(...)
}

.btn-primary {
	(...)
}

.btn-inactive {
	(...)
}

/* In markup */

<ul class="slideShow">
	<li class="slideShow-slide slideShow-slide-eventPromo">
		<a>...</a>
	</li>
</ul>

```

<a name="naming-images"></a>
### Images

Image file names are lowercase with words separated by a dash. File names are prefixed with their usage.

##### Example:

```css
icon-home.png
bg-container.jpg
bg-home.jpg
sprite-top-navigation.png
```

<a name="variables"></a>
## Variables

Naming conventions - camelCase with hyphens

<a name="colors"></a>
### Colors

Use **Sass variables** for color whenever possible. When specifying colors, use the following conventions:

* **HEX:** Always use lowercase. Shorthand like `#ccc` should be used where possible.
* **RGBA:** Remember to include a leading 0 for all decimals, like `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`.

<a name="fonts"></a>
### Fonts

TODO: how @font-face is used and how to specify shared typographic styles.

#### Font Weight

With the additional support of web fonts font-weight plays a more important role than it once did. Different font weights will render typefaces specifically created for that weight, unlike the old days where bold could be just an algorithm to fatten a typeface. Always use the numerical value of font-weight to enable the best representation of a typeface, like `font-weight: 400;`.

Whenever possible use `@extend` to specify appropriate baseline font styles:

```css
$fontSize-micro
$fontSize-smallest
$fontSize-smaller
$fontSize-small
$fontSize-base
$fontSize-large
$fontSize-larger
$fontSize-largest
$fontSize-jumbo
```

(**TODO:** Create the above variables.)

<a name="zindex"></a>
## Z-index

We're modeling Medium's z-index scale, which relies on variables to manage collision-free layers.

##### Example:

```css
// Z-Index Scale (private vars)
// --------------------------------------------------
$zIndex-1:   100;
$zIndex-2:   200;
$zIndex-3:   300;
$zIndex-4:   400;
$zIndex-5:   500;
$zIndex-6:   600;
$zIndex-7:   700;
$zIndex-8:   800;
$zIndex-9:   900;
$zIndex-10: 1000;

// Z-Index Applications
// --------------------------------------------------
$zIndex-1-screenForeground:        @zIndex-1;
$zIndex-1-followUpVisibility:      @zIndex-1;
$zIndex-2-prlWelcome:              @zIndex-2;
$zIndex-2-appImageDropdown:        @zIndex-2;
$zIndex-3-surfaceUnder:            @zIndex-3;
$zIndex-4-blockGroup:              @zIndex-4;
...
```

<a name="mixins"></a>
### Mixins

syntax: `mixinName`

Mixins should only be used when there are dynamic properties, otherwise use @extend. Mixins should use camelCase and be well documented in comments.

<a name="media queries"></a>
#### Media Queries

TODO

##### Example:

```css
@include breakpoint(small) {
	.selector {...}
}
```
<a name="sources"></a>
