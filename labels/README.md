# Labels system
Welcome to the GitHub Labels system! This system is maintained by Ashley Kolodziej in Boston University's Interactive Design department, and is open to any repository in our system. By using this labels system, your repository's labels will automatically update whenever a change is made to our labels system in a non-destructive manner, without any additional work on your part.

The system currently supports custom themes, and will soon be expanded to support other project types such as plugins.

## Opt-in to the Custom Themes labeling system
1. **Add support to your repository:** Add your repository name to the GitHub Labels action here and commit the change. https://github.com/bu-ist/coding-standards/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-labels.yml#L13
2. **Run the labels sync action:** Use the action in this repository to sync labels to your repository (and all others) at any time. This will rename any labels which have been mapped to a particular label, but it will not delete any custom labels you have created.

## Quick tips

* Our labeling system is flexible. Add the labels that make sense for your project!
* Use [the standard](#the-design-system) where possible: the standard label, the standard group, the standard color scheme.
* You don't need to tag labels all at once.
* If you aren't sure how to organize something, leave it **unlabeled**. This makes it easy to find and discuss at your next team meeting.

## Our labels

We base our label structure on the fine principles proposed [here](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63). We start with groups of labels for the following:

- **Status labels:** What dependencies or gotchas do we need to track that may impact work on this issue?
- **Planning labels:** What type of work is this? This is for helping to track what is billable, and when.
- **Task labels:** What is the next thing someone needs to _do_ to move this task forward?
- **Priority labels:** How important is this task? You can choose anything from Critical (prevents launch) to Deferred.
- **Plugin labels:** Which tasks are planned to use plugin functionality?
- **Task type labels:** What type of implementation task is this?

You can see an example of these labels in practice in the [ID Github Demo repository](https://github.com/bu-ist/id-github-demo/issues).

### The design system

Each label group has a color scheme and is always prefixed with an emoji that represents that group except for Status, which uses a fire emoji to denote that a product bug is present.

### Why these labels? What about _____?

Not all projects we take on are built the same way. Some will be very complex child themes and plugins. Others might be as simple as custom CSS. These labels represent the common needs all types of projects share, from the very simple to the very complex. Keeping the standard set of labels as simple as possible creates a lower barrier of entry for new folks. It also allows flexibility for the more complex projects to add their own labels. We think these groups will be a good starting point for your individual project needs 95% of the time - and for those edge cases, you can and should add your own labels!
