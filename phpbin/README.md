# PHPbin Coding Standards & Best Practices

Below is a collection of PHPbin best practices that should be followed in **all code**.

Unlike BU WordPress where we've maintained a standard and used the WordPress code style as our main guide, phpbin has gone on for years with no formal default standard. That has led to our phpbin codebase varying, sometimes drastically and wildly.

On August 9, 2018 we decided to standardize using most of PSR-2 with a few exceptions/customizations:

1. Don't mandate use of four spaces as it is counter to WordPress.

This is a Work In Progress effort to apply a default standard to all PHPbin applications. As it is a WIP, you may find a PHP application that wildly differs from our default standard, for instance BUniverse was built on Zend Framework, in those cases if an exception is not already listed in the repo ask another developer how to proceed.

Because there are other, well maintained best practice manuals available, this guide is meant to supplement them with summaries of the most important items with some internal context.

Those guides are:
